List of Backend errors faced when creating this API 

1) Error: No default engine was specified and no extension was provided.

		Fix: 
		The res.render will throw an error if you're not using a view engine.
		To serve json replace the res.render('error', { error: err });
		lines in code with:
		res.status(err.status || 500);
		res.json({
		  message: err.message,
		  error: err
		});

2) Postman vs Route.rest for Post Requests

		In postman the api is unable to capture information in the req.body and perform res.json when
		an HTTP POST request is sent
		
		Fix: 
		REST Client extension was installed in VS Code 
		A route.rest file was created and the POST request was sent there.
		The api captured all data within the body of that request and performed res.json

	Further research to be done to see why data in POSTMAN body cant be captured 
	
3)  Get Request waiting with no response
	
	Fix: res.json(items) to the showTask() fxn in itemOperations
